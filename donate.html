        <h1>I have no easy way to do this...</h1>
        
        <p>You can donate with paypal, who I hate, but what choice do I have?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log in or sign up for a PayPal account, go to the Request Money tab, and enter the donor's email address and the amount requested.</li>
            <li>The email recipient can donate with their PayPal account or credit cards.</li>
            <li>You'll receive a confirmation email when the donation goes into your PayPal account.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        
        <p>My <b>paypal email address</b> is: <script>document.write((window.btoa || function(v){'decode this, you crappy browser user without <code>btoa</code>: '+v})('a29yeWFrLm90aGVyQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ=='))</script></p>
        <br/>
        
        <p>Note: I use that address only for paypal, I will not respond to emails there and I'll probably not even know you donated until I look at my bank statements.</p>
