Demos were moved into my github hosted site. To grab them do this:

git clone git@github.com:mkoryak/mkoryak.github.com.git
cd mkoryak.github.com/

if you have python:
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    open http://localhost:8000/floatThead

if you have nodejs:
    npm install http-server -g
    http-server
    open http://localhost:8080/floatThead/index.htm

if you have java
    configure and install tomcat... hahahaha

If you don't run in a server, open index.htm but it wont work well in chrome because chrome doesn't play well with pokemon.
